== Welcome to JRubyHub

JRubyHub is a Rails 3 application that showcases JRuby and Java
technologies mixed with Rails.

We're planning to run a live instance of JRubyHub on the
http://jruby.org site eventually. Currently we're in heavy development
mode.

== Development Notes

- We're using a custom fork of Spork for fast re-running of Cucumber
  features in a single JRuby process. We had to tweak some things to
  get this working clean:
  - Nick's Spork fork features a single process looper (originally by
    Roger Pack) that also has to reset the Cucumber::StepMother each
    time so it doesn't report previous runs' results.
  - Set config.cache_classes = false in config/environments/test.rb so
    that code gets reloaded in the test environment. Cucumber warns
    about this breaking its use_transactional_fixtures method, but
    we're not using transactional fixtures here.
  - Run '::ActiveSupport::Dependencies.clear' in the Spork.each_run
    block to reload code.
